                    <p>As is probably obvious by the name at the top of the page, my name is Mitch Slater.
                        I am a graduate student in my first semester of the Computer Science Masters program at Utah State University.
                        I am currently employed by the United States Air Force, who have kindly allowed me to further my education.</p>
                    <p>I grew up primarily in Syracuse, Utah. I attended Clearfield High School before graduating in
                        2012, following which I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
                        in the Philippines. Upon my return, I began attending Brigham Young University and graduated
                        with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2020.</p>
                    <p>Partway through my studies at BYU, I married one of my good friends from high school,
                        and we are enjoying working on our new house and learning and growing with our almost 1-year-old daughter.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy spending my free time (such as it is) hiking, fishing, camping, backpacking, watching
                        and participating in sports, and playing video games.</p>
